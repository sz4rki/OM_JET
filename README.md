This repository contains the source code for the application built as part of the Bachelor's thesis by **Oskar Mikulski**, a Computer Science student at **Vistula University**. </br>
The thesis is titled: **"Design and implementation of automated tests based on Selenium WebDriver in the context of web application testing."**

The repository also includes a video (`TestsVideo.mp4`) demonstrating the automated tests in action.
